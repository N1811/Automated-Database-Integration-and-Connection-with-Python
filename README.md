- Python: You need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Required Python libraries: Install the required Python libraries using `pip`:


- SQL Server: You must have access to a SQL Server instance, and you should know the server name and the database where you want to import the data.
## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the script directly.
2. Configure your SQL Server connection by modifying the following lines in the script:
 ```python
 server = 'YOUR_SQL_SERVER_NAME'
